### Reflection
I completed all the goals but didnt complpete all the stretch goals.

I struggled with using css with the new react components and couldnt figure out how to properly style comments in a way I wanted (getting proper indents and didnt manage to even attempt to include a line/arrow to show child comments).

I couldnt get multi-nested comments to show (I couldnt wrap my head around writing an effective client side function to put the replies to the page in a way I wanted) although I think I wrote a functional server side query for it.

I didnt manage to style things affectivbely

The routing breaks when I use window.location methods and leads to page not found (this did work in development but in deployment)

I did manage to include context which im happy about although I think on reflection that having at local storage would be better in a way or maybe i need to use useRef as the context is cleared on page reloads. There is a way I could avoid client side reloads to refresh the page but I didnt manage to useState effectivly for new comments/replies to avoid this. I feel as though I failed to consistently name comments and replies as well as changing topic to talking point part way .

I feel as though I would have been able to complete other stretch goals but I ran out of time.
